  <h2>Us, in the In-Between</h2>
  <p>
We were never simple.
not messy in a careless way,
just learning each other in a world
that rushes people into labels
before they learn how to stay.

There were moments we felt like “almost,”
like standing at the door of something real
with our hands on the handle,
afraid to open it too fast,
not wanting to rush,
afraid to pretend it was nothing.
We moved like we were official
without saying the word out loud,
and sometimes that silence
was heavier than any title.

Yes, there were days my feelings ran ahead of us,
and i had to learn how to slow my heart down.
Days where the waiting felt loud,
where questions sat in my chest
longer than answers.
But even in the uncertainty,
you never made me feel invisible.
You listened.
You stayed present.
You chose patience when it would’ve been easier to drift.
Oh my.

I’ve seen you try to grow in a generation
that treats people like temporary seasons.
I've seen you choose effort over escape,
clarity over convenience,
and that alone taught me something about love.
No, not the movie kind,
the quiet, intentional kind
that shows up even when it’s uncomfortable.

So here we are,
not perfect, not fully defined,
but honest about wanting to build something real.
And maybe that’s the bravest part of us.
That we’re not rushing the story,
we’re writing it carefully.
If we become, we become with intention.
If we grow, we grow with grace.
And if love is a choice made daily,
then every day,
I'm choosing you,
even in the in between.
